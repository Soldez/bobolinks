	<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was great that it showed up the way it was suppose to. Made me feel like i'm getting somewhere!

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It was fairly easy and again it worked! 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

i did ok.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

i like how everything is layed out for you and uniform. Even if it's repetative the whole lay out makes sense.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I usually use a cheat sheet and refer to it until i can do it without really looking at it like github.
